**Description**
The javascript2python package provides JavaScript developers with a set of functions that mimic the behavior of Python functions. This package provides the following functions:

**print()**: A function that prints a given message to the console, just like Python's print() function.

**range()**: A function that generates a range of numbers, just like Python's range() function.

**map()**: A function that creates a new array by performing a specified function on each element of an input array, just like Python's map() function.

**max()**: A function mimics the behavior of the Python max() function and finds the maximum value in an array.

**min**(): A function replicates the behavior of the Python min() function and finds the minimum value in an array.

**py**: You can use this so you dont have to define anything for example you could do py.print("Hello, World.").

This package is designed to make it easier for developers who are familiar with Python to transition to JavaScript. With javascript2python, developers can use familiar functions from Python in their JavaScript code.

**Installation**
You can install the javascript2python package using npm. Simply run the following command:

```javascript
npm install javascript2python
```
**Usage**
Once you've installed the javascript2python package, you can use the print(), range(), min(), max(), and map() functions in your JavaScript code like this:


```javascript
const { print, range, map, py } = require('javascript2python');

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
print(numbers); // add this line
const square = x => x * x;
const squares = map(numbers, square);
print(squares.join(', ')); // Output: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25
const numbers1 = [4, 2, 9, 7, 5];
py.print(`${max(numbers1)}`) //Output: 9
py.print(`${min(numbers1)}`) //Output: 2
```
If you don't want to define everything you can just do:
```javascript
const { py } = require("javascript2python")
```
The print() function takes one or more arguments, which are printed to the console separated by spaces. The range() function takes two or three arguments: the start value, the end value (exclusive), and the step value (optional). The range() function returns an array containing the values in the specified range. 
The map() function takes two arguments: an array and a function. The function is applied to each element in the array, and the resulting values are returned as a new array. And the max and min functions get the max and min numbers specified in the variable numbers1

**Example**
Here's an example of how to use the javascript2python package to generate a range of numbers and print them to the console:

```javascript
const { print, range, map } = require('javascript2python');

print('Hello, world!'); // Prints "Hello, world!" to the console

const numbers = range(1, 5); // Generates an array containing [1, 2, 3, 4]
const squares = map(numbers || [], x => x * x); // Applies the square function to each element in the array
print(squares.join(', ')); // Prints "1, 4, 9, 16" to the console

```

In this example, we generate a range of numbers from 1 to 10 (exclusive), with a step value of 2. We then print the numbers to the console using the print() function, along with a custom message. We use the spread operator (...) to pass the elements of the numbers array as separate arguments to the print() function.
